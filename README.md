# FriendFinder
FriendFinder is a full-stack application which takes in user results from a ten question survey, then compares their answers with those from other users. The app then displays the name and picture of the user with the best overall match. Each match represents the closest set of user responses with the lowest absolute difference for all questions combined. 

## Demo
